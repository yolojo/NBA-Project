# NBA Project

Every off season NBA Unrestricted and Restricted free agents usually extend their contracts or usually sign new contracts. With this project, I wanted to look at what Player stats actually affect how much a player will make in the offseason. As a basketball enthusiast, I often look certain contracts and go "HOW THE HELL DID HE GET HIS AGENT TO MAKE HIM GET THAT DEAL?". Well, now I can see if some agents use, some of these stats that are not so common to the regular sports fan and see if they contribute to how much a player makes.

In this project, I will be using Simple and Multivariate Linear regression to carry out my Hypothesis Testing.
